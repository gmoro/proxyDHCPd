proxyDHCPd

proxyDHCPd is a proxy DHCP implementation made in pure python and is fully 
compliant with the PXE specification. As a pure python project, it can run on 
Windows, Linux and MacOS (or any other platform that supports python)

But what is proxy DHCP?

Proxy DHCP as defined at PXE specification [1] (see link below to the complete 
PXE spec) is a form of send boot options to clients on a network, without 
relying on DHCP server to hold this options.
This approach solve the problem when you don't want or can't change the main 
DHCP server to send boot options, thus separating the boot logic from the IP 
serving logic.
It could run on the same machine where the DHCP server lives, or in another 
server in the same network, keeping the configuration even more flexible.

Running the server

Just fire up the proxydhcpd executable with 'python proxydhcpd.py', the server will
look for a configuration file called proxy.ini in the same folder as the
executable, or you can set another config file on the command line, the options
for the command line are:
    -c file  : Specify alternate config file.
    -d       : Run as daemon (ignored on Win32)
    -p       : Run just the proxy server (when running on the same machine of 
               the DHCP server)
    -h       : Help
   
It still lacks an init.d script to start automatically (will work on it soon)

The dhcplib module is actually a modified version of pydhcplib

Windows came with an service file to be installed, more instructions to this
soon ;-)

And hey! Its free open source software under GPL license :-)
